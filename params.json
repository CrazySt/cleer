{"name":"Cleer","tagline":"Java media player","body":"cleer\r\n=====\r\n\r\nNightly builds: http://cleer.cc.trousev.pro/nightly/\r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of requirements to media player. I will be satisfied with one, which will:\r\n\r\n * Have \"Media Library\" -- datavase with all my music indexed by ID3 tags\r\n   * Of course, all non-english tags should be supported, even non-standartized.\r\n * Have option to rate my songs and keep rating in ID3 tags, not only in database. I don't want to re-rate all my songs\r\n * Have option to rate my songs automatically, using playing statistics (played count, skip count etc) as source.\r\n * Have search through media library. When i say 'search' i mean 'something powerful as SQL and simple as google'\r\n * Work on linux, windows, mac and my android phone too. \r\n * Cost only 15mb RAM (or near)\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,   I didn't found any player, that suits my needs and I'll write my own.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
